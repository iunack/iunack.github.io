                        <h2>Labrador Retriever</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        The Labrador Retriever, or just Labrador, is a type of retriever-gun dog.<br>
                        The Labrador is one of the most popular breeds of dog in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.<br>

                        A favourite disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid the blind,
                        those who have autism, to act as a therapy dog, or to perform screening and detection work for law
                        enforcement and other official agencies. Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.<br>

                        A few kennels breeding their ancestors, the St. John's water dog, were in England. At the same time,
                        a combination of the sheep protection policy in Newfoundland and rabies quarantine in the United Kingdom,
                        led to the gradual demise of the St. John's water dog in Canada.

                        In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,
                        had imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gundogs.<br>

                        <h2>Rottweiler</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        The Rottweiler (UK: /ˈrɒtvaɪlə/ or /ˈrɒtwaɪlə/, US: /rɒtwaɪlər/)
                        is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large or large.<br>
                        The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil butchers'
                        dogs, because their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with
                        butchered meat to market.<br>
                        This continued until the mid-19th century when
                        railways replaced droving.<br>
                        Although still used to herd stock in many parts
                        of the world, Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs,
                        as guard dogs and police dogs.
